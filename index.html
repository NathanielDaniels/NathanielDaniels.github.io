              <h3>My Past</h3><br>
              <p>Growing up, I had a hard time finding something I was truely passionate about. I've always been a big
                animal person since I grew up around animals, but wasn't sure If I could handle the negatives of being a
                Veterinarian. As a kid, I was into Theater and acted in local plays up until High school, which really
                helped me out of being such an introvert. My Biggest role was The Wizard of Oz! In middle school, I picked up the violin as I really enjoy music. I played in the orcestra all the way though High School. Even though I enjoyed Theater and playing Music, I didn't have that passion or drive to keep pushing forward.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It was difficult for me to decide what I wanted to do for a living, which is something you should do before
                continuing your education. Being an Entrepeneur was definitely something I thought about a lot. I was either
                going to start a Business or become a
                Veterinarian.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It wasn't until College that I got my first laptop, which
                was mainly used for school work. This was the first time I actually had the oppertunity to play around with
                a Computer, since this laptop was Mine! I used that Computer to start a Pet Care Business. I figured, what a
                better way than to mush Business Entrepeneurship with Animal Care! Thats when things changed quickly. The
                business picked up fast and I needed to make a choice, stay at College or build this business into a career. I took
                the chance and started running the business full time. That was over Ten Years Ago.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It wasn't until I needed a website for my Pet Care Business that I realized, I have a Huge obsession with
                Computers and the Internet, which inevitably drew me to Web Development. That Obsession has turned into a
                Passion for Developing Websites. Finally, the passion i've been seeking all this time!</p>

          <!-- <h3>Present</h3> -->

          <p>I have mainly focused on Front-End Web Development. What really peaked my interest was the ability to
            start with an empty slate and build
            anything you can imagine. Once I got going, I realized that I'm
            a huge fan of designing with CSS. Once I learned positions, I though I could do it all. Well, that was
            before I
            found out about
            Flexbox and Grid layouts... my whole World Changed. Things became much clearer from that point forward,
            and my
            code, much cleaner.
            <br></br>
            Next, came the crazy adventure through javascript. Lots of mind blowing moments, especially while
            learning animations with JQuery. I could tinker with animations all day.

            Though, Thanks to a few clients, I started into learning back-end to set up some forms. I had to quickly
            learn how to build a database to store data, then link it to my project. Now I have a working form at
            the bottom of this website that I set up myself.</p>

          <p class="front-end"><span>Font-End:</span> I know HTML, CSS/SASS. Javascript, ES6 and JQuery + Node.js
            (mostly NPM). GIT/Github. I'm very active with the Terminal. I also know how to build HTML Emails.
            Currently, I'm learning React.</p>

          <br>

          <p class="back-end"><span>Back-End:</span> I have worked with PHP and MySQL.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>I am currently interested in both Front-End Web Development and HTML Emails.

          <p>If i'm not coding up something new, you'll find me searching the internet for new ideas, fresh tutorials
            and
            tips and tricks. Soon I'll be writing my own blogs/articles for everyone to learn that next big thing, or
            just my perspective. Even
            though I haven't been in this industry for very long, I strive to become a big name in
            web
            development.</p>
