        <p>Hey, my name is Nathaniel and I'm a driven Self-taught Web Developer from Chicago.</p><br>

        <section class="past hideContent">
          <h3>My Past</h3><br>
          <p>Growing up, I had a hard time finding something I was truely passionate about. I've always been a big
            animal
            person since I grew up around animals, but wasn't sure If I could handle the negatives of being a
            Veterinarian. As a kid, I was into Theater and acted in local plays up until High school, which really
            helped
            me out of being such an introvert. My Biggest role was
            The Wizard of Oz! In middle school, I picked up the violin as I really enjoy music. I played in the orcestra
            all the way though High School. Even though I enjoyed Theater and playing Music, I didn't have that passion
            or
            drive to keep pushing forward.</p>

          <br>

          <p>It was difficult for me to decide what I wanted to do for a living, which is something you should do before
            continuing your education. Being an Entrepeneur was definitely something I thought about a lot. I was either
            going to start a Business or become a
            Veterinarian.</p>

          <br>

          <p>It wasn't until College that I got my first laptop, which
            was mainly used for school work. This was the first time I actually had the oppertunity to play around with
            a
            Computer, since this laptop was Mine! I used that Computer to start a Pet Care Business. I figured, what a
            better way than to mush Business Entrepeneurship with Animal Care! Thats when things changed quickly. The
            business
            picked up fast and I needed to make a choice, stay at College or build this business into a career. I took
            the
            chance and started running the business full time. That was over Ten Years Ago.</p>

          <br>

          <p>It wasn't until I needed a website for my Pet Care Business that I realized, I have a Huge obsession with
            Computers and the Internet, which inevitably drew me to Web Development. That Obsession has turned into a
            Passion for Developing Websites. Finally, the passion i've been seeking all this time!</p>
